Abagcoin Core



Setup



Abagcoin Core is the original Abagcoin client and it builds the backbone of
the network. It downloads and, by default, stores the entire history of Abagcoin
transactions (which is currently more than 7 GBs); depending on the speed of
your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take
anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.



To download Abagcoin Core, visit abagcoin.org.
